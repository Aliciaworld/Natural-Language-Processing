A simple n-gram model would not be able to capture all of dependencies in one sentence.

n-gram model will not be able to encode information seen previously in the datset, as a result, the perplexity will increase. (The higher the perplexity, the worse the model is)

n-gram models takes up too much space and memory. It is inefficient and too slow. 

However, n-gram allow us better understand deep learning.
