    . Bilingual evaluation understudy
    . Compare candidate translations to reference(human) translations
    . range(0,1)
    . closer to 1, better

2. Rouge score(can be though as recall)
    . recall oriented understuy of gisting evaluation
    . there are many version of rouge, here we'll use Rouge-N

3. F1=2 * BLEU * Rouge-N/(BLEU - Rouge-N)

Disadvantege of these two metric:
    . doesn't consider semantic meaning
    . doesn't consider sentence structure
