Sigmoid activation function is also called the logistic function. Regardless of the input, the function always outputs a value between 0 and 1. The form of the function is an s-shape between 0 and 1 with the vertical or middle of the S at 0.5.

This allows very large values given as the weighted sum of the input to be output as 1.0 and very samall or negative values to be mapped to 0.0.

The sigmoid activation is an ideal activation function for a binary classification problem where the output is interpreted as a Binomial probability distribution.
